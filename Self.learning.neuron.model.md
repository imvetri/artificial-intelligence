# Self learning neuron model

## Introduction

This is construction of a neural model that is not based on mathematical model. One of the primary motivation to frame alternative models to mathematical model is that, life is short and math is hard. After establishing a neural model, we are going to construct a self learning neural model and steps to acheive it using software tools.

### Neuron model

A neuron is a fluid that spreads into space. When a new impulse is sensed, it passes through the same path. when a new impulse similar to exisitng arrives, it creates a new path from the point where mismatch occurs. When same impulse is sensed, it hits all path and reverse impulse hits back. 


### Self learning

A self learning is a learning system that learns about itself and uses the learnt information to learn about its surroundings. ( In plain programming terms, it is recursive. In Modern AI architecture it is called recurrent NN.)


### What defines a self learning neuron model?

We have a neuron model, and we have a self learning rules. Next we are going to stitch them together.

"Definition of neuron says it is a fluid that is spread in space." - ok

"It spreads based on the impulse it receives" - ok. from where through what ? it does not say.

"A neuron can learn and store information" - ok. but how? don't get into that rabbit hole. we will stay away from math zone.

"Let the neuron learn about itself" - Dammit. how?.. no clue. Don't think about this either. 



Repeat this untill brain starts believing it. 

"Neuron is a fluid that spreads on space based on impulse. When new impulse is received it spreads on space. When exisitng impulse is received it sends back impulse."
"Neuron is a fluid that spreads on space based on impulse. When new impulse is received it spreads on space. When exisitng impulse is received it sends back impulse."
"Neuron is a fluid that spreads on space based on impulse. When new impulse is received it spreads on space. When exisitng impulse is received it sends back impulse."

Lets experiement with this istead of thinking hard. - ok


## System design

Ingredients 
1. Number of eyes - 1 min nos
2. Fluid - light

Software alternative ingredient
1. eye - blender camera or vision_blender  https://github.com/Cartucho/vision_blender
2. Fluid - blenderNeuron https://blenderneuron.org/

## Conclusion

Take baby steps. Use light as source. Wait for it to learn space time corrdination. Then teach it assembly commands starting with move.
