# Engines build other engines

## The machine learns to build other engines.

### Introduction

The AI design has diffenrent engines that share the same knowledge about the system from the knowledge graph. The first knowledge that it posses helps to create engines that builds itself. At the some point in the first knowledge, the program builds itself a commanding engine and actor engine. With the knowledge, commanding engine and actor engine, the program then builds a questioning engine and an aswering engine.

### Knowledge graph

The knowledge graph is made of words. The words form connections and provides meanings based on the engine tha reads the graph. As the machine grows more knowlege it cleans complicated knowledge to simple connections that saves effort to traverse itself.

### Conclusion

The machine learns gradually by building the engines that is minimal for it to learn the hardware and process model that is energy efficient.
