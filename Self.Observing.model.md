# Self observing model

    A self observing model is a something that can observe itself and its surroundings. 

##  Observation 
    
    Brain is a fluid that can observe itself and surroundings. 

## Refine obervation

    A fluid can observe itself and surroundings.

## Reason 

    Brain isn't the only fluid that can observe itself and surroundings.

    Brain isn't the only learning system in our surroudnings.

    Neural networks are not the only learning networks.

    Neural cells are not the only learning cells.

    Every cell can learn.

    So it is naive to think that only neurons can learn and its naive to build a learning sytem based on neural networks and build a computational model based on neural network. - One more reason to realise that modern AI is fundamentally flawed.



## Dancing droplet experiement

    An interesting observation by Manu Prakash. But the topic got deviated into computing because he compared his finding with Alan turing's computing model and started proposing a new computing model. Alan turing is a computing model where as dancing droplets is an observing model - Its superior !


## My learnings

    Needed a neural network that can sense itself and its surroundings. - Definetely not AI NN so I chased a graph based design - [Mathematical neuron model - Alternative](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Alternative.Neuron.Model.Without.Advanced.Math.md) 

    That gave lot of confidence in not to chase math and AI NN.

    A fruit fly's brain got my attention and gave me an idea that brain is just a fluid that can change shape based on its surroundings and I came up with an experiment to try - [Self Learning Neuron Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.learning.neuron.model.md)


    Wait a minute, brain isn't the only fluid that can change shape based on surroundings. - Water is also a fluid - hahaha. Look at dancing droplets!

    Fine- 

    But

    The experiment got side tracked into explaining that behaviour with mixed concepts of surface tension and evaporation. Thank you so much.


    At last, I envountered a video on quantum computing simulation. 

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bzE1E5PMY&t=2s - Gave me hope !

## Conclusion

Zero interest in AI NN based on mathematical model
Fluids are a good model
Next need a computer setup that can simulate drops based on quantum physics. Dont learn anything on quantim physics, instead try out tools such as ProjectQ, PyQuil, QuTIP
