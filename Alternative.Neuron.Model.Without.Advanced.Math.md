# Mathematical Neuron Model - Alternative

## Neuron 

A neuron is made of a biological material and is squishy whooshy.

## Artifical Neuron

A neuron is made of Mathematical biological model of overly confusing, with methodological symptoms of early crusifiction 

## Reason for complex model

Human head which can memorise things easily wins first. Everything work fine untill the victory and supermacy starts to dance off with unhealthy pride. Also it sounds geeky/nerdy. And the root cause is the aggresive business model that pushes poor developer to cook up something just to have fun at the big lords. While there was a plan to help and teach others, but the person got promoted and became part of the managment pack. The marketing team exchanges under table deals and silences the mind of the good soul. 

## Reason for the simple model

Cant let my friends learn math. 

## Artificial Intelligence

An artificial intelligence is capable of pretending to be smart when fed with junk amount of data. It answers right when it forms the right shape.

## Whats wrong?

API changes to machine learning frameworks, Math in code, Code is no readable. Design of Neuron is fundamentally flawed and pile of APIs is built on top of it. 

## Whats right?

If you have to solve a problem using linear algebra or other forms of math, build a set of neurons that will solve it for you. Thats what a computer is meant to do. A biological machine called human should be let free to live its life while the machine does its job. But world is built on business model where people are involved. Tech mind thinks if they are smart it will be difficult for the bullies to understand them and fail to acknoledge the truth. If you have to fight the bully, get into fight. DO NOT RUN AWAY AND COME BACK WITH SOMETHING others wouldn't understand to save the world. Face the blade, get a mark on face. Thats how you fight, not by running away from your homeland because of a childhood fight and prooving the world who-is-big-now.

## In other words,

Neuron model should be recursive, built on itself. Since it solves math, remodel the neuron to reflect a math.

Math is made of numbers. Numbers are size and length. Let a neuron be just a number.

What about computation? Build the neuron from scratch starting from fundamental operations and pile up. 

## Wait

This model is the code that we write. 

Exactly. But a visual model of computation code that we write will take the shape of neural network.

## Conclusion

Neuron is made of number, a node is a deciding factor/ math operation.
