## [Efficient power consumption design ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Power.efficient.AI.design.md)

Details about reusing computing resource.

## [Non Neuron Learning Machine design ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/No.Neuron.Learning.Machine.md)

Alternative to mathematical Neuron model.

## [Self Learning Engine Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.learning.engine.model.md)

Core design of self learning system

## [A Connected Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/A.Connected.Model.md)

Architecture that learns, can be applied at any layer of a computing machine.


## [Engine builds engine ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Engines.build.other.engines.md)

The first program, the first knowledge, the first command, the first question, the first answer. And the engines.
