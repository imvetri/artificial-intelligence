# System design - Artificial intelligence

### [Efficient power consumption design ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Power.efficient.AI.design.md)

Details about reusing computing resource.

### [Non Neuron Learning Machine design ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/No.Neuron.Learning.Machine.md)

Alternative to mathematical Neuron model.

### [Self Learning Engine Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.learning.engine.model.md)

Core design of self learning system

### [A Connected Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/A.Connected.Model.md)

Architecture that learns, can be applied at any layer of a computing machine.


### [Engine builds engine ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Engines.build.other.engines.md)

The first program, the first knowledge, the first command, the first question, the first answer. And the engines.


### [Music track segmentation without AI](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Music.track.segmentation.without.AI.md)


Example for adjusting hypothesis to get 100% result.

### [Mathematical neuron model - Alternative](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Alternative.Neuron.Model.Without.Advanced.Math.md)

Learning AI is hard because of math. Math is introduced because neural node is made of function. This model proposes such nodes to be made of other tiny nodes and connections to nodes, which is dendrites represent a number and node performs a  mathematical operation.

### [Self Learning Neuron Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.learning.neuron.model.md)

Bare metal experiment and Abstracts out unwanted stuffs.

### [Protein folding ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Protein.folding.md)

Light and Mechanical movement of protein


### [Self Observing Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.Observing.model.md)

Brain is a fluid of varying density that can store information about itself and its surroundings. 
A fluid of varying densities can store information about itself and its surroundings. 
A fluid can observe itself and its surroundings.

## [The System](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/The System.md)


## Motivation

Neural network is a shape changing data structure. Hyped definition such as mathematical model spikes the mind. Do not believe in math model of neuron.
