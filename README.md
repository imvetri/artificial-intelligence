# System design - Artificial intelligence 

### [Efficient power consumption design ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Power.efficient.AI.design.md)

Details about reusing computing resource.

### [Non Neuron Learning Machine design ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/No.Neuron.Learning.Machine.md)

Alternative to mathematical Neuron model.

### [Self Learning Engine Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.learning.engine.model.md)

Core design of self learning system

### [A Connected Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/A.Connected.Model.md)

Architecture that learns, can be applied at any layer of a computing machine.


### [Engine builds engine ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Engines.build.other.engines.md)

The first program, the first knowledge, the first command, the first question, the first answer. And the engines.


### [Music track segmentation without AI](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Music.track.segmentation.without.AI.md)


Example for adjusting hypothesis to get 100% result.

### [Mathematical neuron model - Alternative](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Alternative.Neuron.Model.Without.Advanced.Math.md)

Learning AI is hard because of math. Math is introduced because neural node is made of function. This model proposes such nodes to be made of other tiny nodes and connections to nodes, which is dendrites represent a number and node performs a  mathematical operation.

### [Self Learning Neuron Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.learning.neuron.model.md)

Bare metal experiment and Abstracts out unwanted stuffs.

### [Protein folding ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Protein.folding.md)

Light and Mechanical movement of protein


### [Self Observing Model ](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/Self.Observing.model.md)

Brain is a fluid of varying density that can store information about itself and its surroundings. 
A fluid of varying densities can store information about itself and its surroundings. 
A fluid can observe itself and its surroundings.

## [The Design](https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/blob/master/The%20System.md)


## Motivation

Neural network is a shape changing data structure. Hyped definition such as mathematical model spikes the mind. Do not believe in math model of neuron.

## Conclusion
This is an attempt to design a self learning system and it got deviated into computer science concept such as self modifying algorithm and self learning neural network. Without stating how a self learning algorithm should work it is not wise to get into implementation. I concluded when I was able to define both modern and conventional computation as follows.

```Input + function = output``` - This is a program
```Input + output = function``` - This is learning for future.

and what about 
```Output + function = input``` - This is learning for past. Seek the origin. When networked ML/AI agents start in this direction, hope something amazing happens.


## todo 
https://github.com/IntelAI/models/tree/master/benchmarks/image_recognition/tensorflow/densenet169 Try to see what's inside the pb file. I'm giving up trying to read that file's content. Tried an online tool called netron but that's giving me all the functions used against an input! I need to see the graph nodes and edges not math !
