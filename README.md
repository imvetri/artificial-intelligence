# Artificial-intelligence system design ideas

## Efficient power consumption design

### Introduction

An AI requires high computation for training model. When an AI becomes close to 100% trained, the model will closely resemble 2d curve if in case the data is 2d and 3d solids if the data is a 3d and it goes on dependending on the dimension of the data.

### Current system

A trained model is function that evaluates to a result. When an AI is put into use, the test data is run through the networks to find out the results. This technique is unnecessary and there is an alternative technique.

### Efficient system

Since the trained model is a function, it can be exported as part of a program that can be executed to recive input and returns an output, instead of using the Neural network to run.

### Conclusion

When a neural system learns, it finds a function that solves the problem. Once the problem is solved, and the function is exported, the AI can be reset to be used to solve the next problem.
