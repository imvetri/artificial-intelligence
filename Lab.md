Hello, Welcome to lab. 

## Experiments

### Eye

#### Steps

1. Build a neuron.
2. Build an eye.
3. Put a spherical mirror around the eye.


#### Status - onHold

Waiting for right neuron neuron model.

### Point, fluid.

#### Draft notes 

<b>Write about fluid.</b>

Fluid is made of points. 


<b>Write about point.</b>

Point has position relative to another point.
Point has same property as a fluid.
Fluid is a point for observer from far.

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Write about observer.</b>
Observer can see a point.
A fluid becomes a point to an observer from far.
Observer can see light.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Write about light.</b>
A point is light seen by observer.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fluid is made of points.
Fluid is a point seen from far.
Points on fluid are seen by observer from close.
OBSERVER BECOMES FLUID AND CAN SEE OUTSIDE.
An observer is fluid.
An observer can see.
A fluid can see.
A fluid can take shape.
A point can see.

<b>Write about seeing.</b>

Seeing is observing.

Seeing properties of a point change over properties of a point and it's surroundings.

A point can see it's surroundings.

<b>Write about properties.</b>
<b>Write about seeing change.</b>

A point can see in one direction.
A point can see short and long direction.
Point can see more farther distance.
Point can see less closer distance.

<b>Write about zero distance.</b> Something flips.

Point observes at zero distance.


<b>Write difference between seeing and observing.</b>
Seeing is other points.
Observing seeing itself. (Incorrect. Observing is changing itself based on what it sees)

<b>Write about properties.</b>
Direction of seeing.
Distance of seeing.

<b>Write about what happens when seeing.</b>

A point changes when it sees.

<b>Write about what changes when it sees.</b>
Direction, distance of other point's seeing.

Seeing is interconnected.
All points in a fluid are connected.

<b>Write about math</b>
Addition makes sense, but subtraction doesn't here is why. Additon is simple but subtraction needs overthinking and it is created by someone who felt competitive against someone who found addition. Instead of solving the original problem, they deviated giving rise to delusional tree of mathematics.
Mathematics is a delluded mind's escape from simple answers because if it looks complicated it gains attention and a mind which gets carried away falls prey for that smart mind.
Draft video

Record a video about points for above rules.


### Neural fluid.

A neural fluid can see light, sense its surroundings, creates a virtual world within in to understand the outside world,

1. Build a neural fluid


### Group of spheres - neural fluid I was looking for.

Tada. Notes to self.

Alternative experiment to do in computer.

Make each sphere with a neuron that learns about space, time (given n cordinates of movement, how many cpu cycles it took to move). 



Next make each sphere made of optical material that can see outside from within. 

Wait until the sphere learns a visual model of its surroundings.


Now the sphere can predict movement of other spheres in motion. It can focus on a single particular sphere.


Let it find a way to communicate and then human snoop in.


The sphere learns about itself from other sphere. (A group of spheres atached to them self and mimicing a sea wave) 



Overall a good candidate to be in here

### FAQs
1. What's the frequency of the sun
2. What's a dimension - dimension is perpendicular to current dimension. Haha 
3. What's observing? - Eye watching a fluid flow followed by change in structure of its neuron.
4. What happens when neurons are exposed to light than just eye - Neurons are more sensitive to light than eye.
5. What's a fire ðŸ”¥ and water ðŸ’¦ ? Fire flows outward and water flows inward. Fire is a fluid. Light flows outward.huh. 
6. Fire flows outward and matter flows inward. E=mc^2 c is not the speed of light, it's the speed of space expansion.
7. There is a mass in an empty space. No, there is a mass and only space is the mass. When the space is pulled outward, what happens? Mass gets converted to energy and space is expanded. What happens when this space is shrunk? The energy gets converted to mass. What about the light that passed? That's why c is speed of space.
8. When there is just a mass in the beginning, then how or what expanded it ? 
9. When Space expands it emits light and when space compresses it sucks light to form matter. 
10.What's connection between space and light? C is speed of space expansion.


### Inspiration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3-3Y8gDbPA - a logic gates based computing built using fluid
https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/lt0bat/a_computer_architecture_built_in_logicly/ - a logic gates simulator. build the neural OS inside a simulator and pour neural fluid around it. *Fun*

### Collect interesting computer architectures

Start with non von neumann

### pieces
Each neuron runs as OS process.

Put neurons to the gameplay characters head, as the player controls a character the neural fluid models itself.


## Problem
Yay found a new problem statement. AI in other words - Given a set of input and output, figure out a system that will build the function. (Since I do not know much AI and already made a simple statement (here)[https://github.com/imvetri/artificial-intelligence/#conclusion] let me see if I can come up with a design that can do it. One more time, Given inputs and outputs, generate a system that will form the function, something that is fluidy. 

### Step one
Given a set of points, find equation for it, Googling resulted here https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2183356/finding-equation-from-a-set-of-points. wait, rather than trying to find the equation how about plotting the points based on the dimension and use the neural vision to guess whether the next set of input might fall in the graph plotted region or not. Haha. Its funny, because we can use the image classifier on top plotted points. Anyways, there was this idea I got from ui-editor. It is basically stitching every known thing in the Web and DOM API together and solving, How to stitch all the known AI systems together and see what happens ? How about stop talking and show some code. That's the point, AI ecosystem is vast and I question why there isn't any popular tool like (ML Agents in unity)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5m_nDBvS4&t=515s] . Yeah, I thought of creating a neuron as an agent hahaha. that's funny and trippy. That's a good sign. Funny and trippy is a recursion, recursion is a good sign for computer but not for human head. Hahaha that's funny because human head is going to be outside the unity and inside the unity. Yeah, it all boils around the samething. A neuron that can create other neuron that can occupy 3d space and exist as a code (as a safegaurd so that in future If they evolve so much, they will find only about themself and not get lost, another recursion.)


### review
Stop wasting so much computing power https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OpodKCR6P-M&t=646s. Generate all the possible values for the obstacle distance. Ideal path is the center line. Forget this and stick to front end.

## Motivation

Neural network is a shape changing data structure. Hyped definition such as mathematical model spikes the mind. Do not believe in math model of neuron.

## Conclusion
This is an attempt to design a self learning system and it got deviated into computer science concept such as self modifying algorithm and self learning neural network. Without stating how a self learning algorithm should work it is not wise to get into implementation. I concluded when I was able to define both modern and conventional computation as follows.

```Input + function = output``` - This is called a program.

```Input + output = function``` - This is called ML/AI. 

and what about

```Output + function = input``` - This is learning for past. Seek the origin. When networked ML/AI agents start in this direction, hope something amazing happens.


## todo 
https://github.com/IntelAI/models/tree/master/benchmarks/image_recognition/tensorflow/densenet169 Try to see what's inside the pb file. I'm giving up trying to read that file's content. Tried an online tool called netron but that's giving me all the functions used against an input! I need to see the graph nodes and edges not math ! If it really works, next step is to build a visualiser.

Wonder why not the neural networks look like this https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-1067787113-vertical-display-format-futuristic-virtual-holographic-head
