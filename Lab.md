Hello, Welcome to lab. 

## Experiments

### Eye

#### Steps

1. Build a neuron.
2. Build an eye.
3. Put a spherical mirror around the eye.


#### Status - onHold

Waiting for right neuron neuron model.

### Point, fluid.

#### Draft notes 

Write about fluid.

Fluid is made of points. 


Write about point.

Point has position relative to another point.
Point has same property as a fluid.
Fluid is a point for observer from far.

Write about observer.
Observer can see a point.
A fluid becomes a point to an observer from far.
Observer can see light.


Write about light.
A point is light seen by observer.


Fluid is made of points.
Fluid is a point seen from far.
Points on fluid are seen by observer from close.
OBSERVER BECOMES FLUID AND CAN SEE OUTSIDE.
An observer is fluid.
An observer can see.
A fluid can see.
A fluid can take shape.
A point can see.

Write about seeing.

Seeing is observing.

Seeing properties of a point change over properties of a point and it's surroundings.

A point can see it's surroundings.

Write about properties.
Write about seeing change.

A point can see in one direction.
A point can see short and long direction.
Point can see more farther distance.
Point can see less closer distance.

Write about zero distance. Something flips.

Point observes at zero distance.


Write difference between seeing and observing.
Seeing is other points.
Observing seeing itself.

Write about properties.
Direction of seeing.
Distance of seeing.

Write about what happens when seeing.

A point changes when it sees.

Write about what changes when it sees.
Direction, distance of other point's seeing.

Seeing is interconnected.
All points in a fluid are connected.



Draft video

Record a video about points for above rules.


### Neural fluid.

A neural fluid can see light, sense its surroundings, creates a virtual world within in to understand the outside world,

1. Build a neural fluid
