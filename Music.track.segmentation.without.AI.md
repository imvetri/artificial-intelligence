# Music track segmentation without using AI

Most of the computational problem is solvable by human. The reason sequence programs became popular than mathematics during 1970 is because mathematical brain has no life, such brains are hard to find in society. But a brain with life is easy to find and such brains pick up solving problems sequentialy, for example writing a program to add two numbers than doing the math in the head.

AI will no catch up as it requires math in the head. We are natural problem solvers, math is an art created by someone else. It is real, it exists. An art is effortless for creator to understand but not for the visitor. Just like that, math is not fun except for the brain that created it. And they all are dead. 

Solve problems without other's technique. Solving problems with what we already know is the least resistance and more fun part.

AI will catch up just because of the competition, and the mind will find the truth, 1970s cycle will repeat again.

Here is an example to solve audio segmentation problem without using AI.

## Introduction

An AI capable of splitting a musical track into different instruments and vocal track works by distributing the data across 3d space, it self trains using a reccurent network to split the tracks into different segments. A musical track is a three dimension data with time, frequency and amplitude and this can be done without heavy computation of training a neural network


## System design

1. The music file is passed through frequency filters such that a single slice has a fixed frequency with varying amplitude across the time.

2. The slices are stitched back together in a 3d plane to get a visualisation of the song.

3. To extract the track, take a roller coaster ride by moving the 2d playhead in 3d plane to catch the instrument. Like you are the orchestrator in a symphony instead of two hands, do with thumb and index.

## Conclusion

Why this works? An AI solves a data by running the neural nets over and over again to find that hypothetical function. Untill it can solve 100% correct a human will keep adjusting the hypothesis. The roller coaster ride is the example of adjusting the hypothesis. Since you like musci you will do a better job at it than a computer.
