# Protein Folding

## Introduction

Protein folding is the behaviour of a protein that helps it to perform its duties. Folding problem has been an unsolved problem for over 5 decades and looks like it has been solved by AI and I'm not sure how, but I have some take away that was filling the msising gap I had about light. 

For neural fluid I frameed fluid theory and light is also part of it. One thing that I was looking for answer is how light can be used to thicken or lighten a fluid and I think I can take some inspiration from protein folding.

## Conclusion

Light is the source of protein folding and I'm connecting it with my fluid theory as its foundation is light itself a fluid.
